Charitable is a powerful, extendable fundraising plugin that gives you full control over your website donations. 

== Description ==

**[Charitable](https://www.wpcharitable.com/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=intro&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)** is the WordPress Fundraising Toolkit. It's a robust, developer-friendly plugin that gives you complete control over your online fundraising.

= Easy to use =

Install, activate and create your first fundraising campaign in less than 5 minutes. With Charitable, adding campaigns is a straightforward, intuitive process. Less time setting up campaigns means more time for you to raise awareness for your campaign.

= Payment gateway support = 

PayPal and offline donations are supported out of the box. When you're ready to start accepting donations through a different payment gateway, you can choose one of our premium gateway add-ons: 

* **[Stripe](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-stripe?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)**
* **[Authorize.Net](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-authorize-net?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)**
* **[PayUMoney](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-payu-money/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=extensions&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals)**

Need a payment gateway that wasn't listed? [Let us know](https://www.wpcharitable.com/support?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=credit-card-donations&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals).

= Use Peer-to-Peer Fundraising to expand your reach = 

With our [Charitable Ambassadors extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-ambassadors?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description-tab&utm_content=peer-to-peer-fundraising&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals), you can use peer-to-peer fundraising to leverage your supportersâ€™ network of friends and family. 

Ambassadors adds a frontend campaign submission form. People can create fundraisers for your cause or personal causes, allowing you to create a crowdfunding platform powered by Charitable Ambassadors.

= Skip the transaction fees = 

Other fundraising software charges you for every donation you receive. 

Charitable is different. We won't charge you any transaction fees and you can use Charitable for free.

= Unlimited fundraising campaigns = 

You can set up as many campaigns as you'd like with Charitable, and you can tailor them to your needs. You can set up suggested donation amounts, allow them to donate as much as they want, or do both.

Need to set a fundraising goal? No problem. 

Running a time-sensitive campaign? Set an end date for your campaign and give it a sense of urgency.

= Works with any theme = 

Charitable has been designed to work with any well-coded theme, including the default WordPress themes.

= Extensions = 

One size does *not* fit all. That's why we made Charitable an extendable platform.

= I don't want to send my donors to PayPal. How can I accept donations right on my site? =

You can accept donations with the Offline Donations gateway, which allows your donors to create a donation and make the payment via cheque or bank transfer (you can display your payment details to them).

You can also accept credit card donations with the [Stripe extension](https://www.wpcharitable.com/extensions/charitable-stripe?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=avoid-paypal&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals).

Easy. Just add `[campaigns]` into your page content. [Read more](https://www.wpcharitable.com/documentation/the-campaigns-shortcode?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq-tab&utm_content=campaigns-shortcode&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals).

Support for recurring donations will be added as an extension, but is not yet available.

== Changelog ==

=======
= 1.4.0 - Unreleased = 
* Added a `charitable_create_donation()` function for developers who want to create donations programatically. [#109](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/109)
* Added a new `Charitable_Deprecated` class, which is used to record any incorrect usage of Charitable functions or methods.
* Added a `Charitable_Donor::__toString()` method, so that echoing the object simply prints out the donor name.
* Added `charitable_sanitize_amount()` function to convert any amount of type string into a float.
* Trim the currency symbol from monetary amounts to prevent the symbol being treated as part of the amount. [#145](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/pull/145)
* Trim the currency symbol from the suggested donation amounts when saving a campaign. [#147](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/147)

= 1.3.7 = 
* Makes `Charitable_Currency::get_currency_symbol()` a publicly accessible method.
* Allow email shortcode values to be dynamically generated without being registered first. This simplifies the process of displaying dynamic data within emails if there is no existing shortcode output for it. [#134](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/134)
* Provide a consistent api for determining the status of a campaign. Developers can use `$campaign->get_status_key()` (where `$campaign` is a `Charitable_Campaign` object) to check whether a campaign is inactive, ended, ended and successfully funded, ended and not successfully funded, ending soon, or active. 
* Reset the positioning and styling of the modal when window or modal change in size. This prevents the modal from growing larger than the size of the window without having scrollbars. [#135](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/135)

= 1.3.6 = 
* Prevented campaigns being created with no suggested donation amounts and custom donations disabled. This results in $0 donations. [#127](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/127)
* Fixed errors when exporting donations with errors set to display. [#128](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/128)
* Deprecated `Charitable_Email::return_value_if_has_valid_donation()` method, since this was completely broken and should not be used.

= 1.3.5 =
* Added `is_preview()` method to `Charitable_Email` class. 
* Added `get_donations()` method to `Charitable_Donor` class.
* Improved custom post status labels.
* Only include completed payments in the Donation Statistics dashboard widget, for the period summaries. 
* Fixed PHP notices in email previews.
* Deprecated `Charitable_Session::get_session_id()`. We are no longer using a public session ID.

= 1.3.4 =
* Added selective refresh support for Charitable widgets.
* Added support for passing multiple campaign IDs to campaign donation queries. [#112](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/112)
* Fixed a bug where donors without a completed donation were included in the donor count in the Donation Stats widget. [#114](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/114)
* Fixed a bug that incorrectly set the from address for emails to always be the site email address, instead of using the provided settings. [#113](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/113)
* Fixed a bug that stopped the cron scheduler from being activated in any new installs. 
* Fixed display issues in the Charitable settings area with number fields.
* Deprecated usage of `shortcode_atts()` for the email shortcode, in favor of `wp_parse_args()`. If you relied on the `shortcode_atts_charitable_email` filter, this will no longer do anything and you should test & update your code.

= 1.3.3 = 
* Fixes a bug that prevented donors being able to access their donation receipts after making their donation.
* Flush rewrite rules after installation to avoid "Page not found" errors.

= 1.3.2 = 
* Fixed a bug that turned comments off everywhere. [#104](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/104)
* Added a better fallback for donations for users with Javascript enabled, when using the modal donation forms. [#60](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/60)
* Avoid sending donation notifications & receipts multiple times when a donation's status is toggled on/off Paid. [#96](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/96)
* Donate button in campaign grids links to the campaign page when the donation form is set up to show on the same page as the campaign. [#107](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/107)
* Fixed a bug that caused invalid shortcode options to show for custom emails sub-classing `Charitable_Email`. [#95](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/95)

= 1.3.1 = 
* **APOLOGIES**: 1.3.0 introduced a couple of bugs that we failed to pick up on before releasing the update. We have fixed those bugs now and are working on improving the process around how we push out updates, to avoid issues like this in the future. 
* Removes leftover testing code that prevented campaigns from being created or edited.
* Format the donation amount so that PayPal can understand it (PayPal doesn't like amounts with more than two decimal places). [See issue](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/102) 
* Prevent PHP notice when making a donation. [See issue](https://github.com/Charitable/Charitable/issues/100)
* Fixes a bug that prevented the Donate widget from working as expected.

All templates are now loaded via a single method: `Charitable_Templates::template_loader()`. All custom body classes are added via `charitable_add_body_classes()`. `Charitable_Templates::remove_admin_bar_from_widget_template()` has been replaced with `charitable_hide_admin_bar()`.

[See the documentation](https://www.wpcharitable.com/documentation/the-campaigns-shortcode/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=changelog-tab&utm_campaign=plugin-page-referrals&utm_content=1-2-3-release) for details on how to use the new argument.
